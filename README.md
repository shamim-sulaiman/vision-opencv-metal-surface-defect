## Metal Surface Defect Detection using OpenCV

This interactive Streamlit app allows users to explore and detect surface defects on metal using multiple OpenCV-based methods.

### Features
- Select from 6 defect classes (scratches, inclusion, patches, etc.)
- Preview raw and processed images side-by-side
- Choose between 4 real-time detection modes:
  - `Canny`
  - `Adaptive Thresholding`
  - `Otsu's Thresholding`
  - `Morphological Gradient`
- Adjustable sliders for parameter tuning
- Compact, responsive UI built in Streamlit

### Detection Logic (OpenCV)
Implemented in [`utils/defect_detector.py`](utils/defect_detector.py), where image processing modes are controlled by parameters and visualized live.

### Dataset
This app uses the NEU Metal Surface Defect Dataset:
- 6 defect types
- 300 samples each (200x200 BMP images)
- Source: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fantacher/neu-metal-surface-defects-data)

> Dataset should be placed in the `dataset/` folder with subfolders like this, if you want to add your own:
```
dataset/
├── scratches/
│   ├── 1.bmp
│   ├── 2.bmp
│   └── ...
├── patches/
│   ├── 1.bmp
│   └── ...
├── inclusion/
│   └── ...
├── pitted_surface/
├── rolled_in_scale/
├── crazing/
...
```

### How To Use
You can use the [web-based dashboard here](https://metal-defect-detector.streamlit.app/) 
or you can run locally by following steps below;

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shamim-sulaiman/vision-opencv-metal-surface-defect.git
cd vision-opencv-metal-surface-defect
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run web_app.py
```
